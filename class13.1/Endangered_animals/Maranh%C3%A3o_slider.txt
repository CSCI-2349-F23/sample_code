 The Maranhão slider (Trachemys adiutrix), also commonly known as the Brazilian slider or Carvalho's slider, is a species of turtle in the family Emydidae. Trachemys adiutrix is endemic to northeastern Brazil. One of its English common names refers to the Brazilian state of Maranhão, but it also occurs in the Brazilian state of Piauí. The specific name, adiutrix, which is Latin feminine for "helper", comes in honor of Dr. Maria do Socorro Pinheiro, field companion of Vanzolini. Her surname, Socorro, means "help" in Portuguese. The eponym, Carvalho's slider, is in honor of Brazilian herpetologist Antenor Leitão de Carvalho. T. adiutrix is sometimes considered a subspecies of T. dorbigni as T. dorbigni adiutrix.
