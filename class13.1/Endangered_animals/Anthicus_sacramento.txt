It can be found in sand dune areas along the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers from Shasta to San Joaquin counties, and from the Feather River at Nicolaus. It is threatened by riverside development, canalization and river drainage. This Anthicidae-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.
