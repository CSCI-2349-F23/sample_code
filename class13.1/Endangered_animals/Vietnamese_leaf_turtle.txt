 The black-breasted leaf turtle (Geoemyda spengleri), also commonly called the Vietnamese leaf turtle or the black-breasted hill turtle, is a species of turtle in the family Geoemydidae (formerly called Bataguridae). The species is endemic to Southeast Asia. G. spengleri is found in the wild in China, Vietnam and Laos. The specific name, spengleri, is in honor of Danish naturalist Lorenz Spengler. Through locality samples from the three Chinese provinces Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan, the G. spengleri is found to be one of the surviving species due to its secretive terrestrial mode of life and small size. They are seen going extinct due to overexploitation and large-scale habitat alteration. The G. spengleri is still present in many regions where other chelonian species are extinct or near extinct.
