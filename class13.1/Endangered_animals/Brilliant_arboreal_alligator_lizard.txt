 The brilliant arboreal alligator lizard (Abronia gaiophantasma) is a species of lizard endemic to Guatemala. This species is restricted to the mountains of east-central Guatemala, from the Sierra de las Minas east to the Chilascó region. It occurs at elevations of 1,600–2,650 m, and can be found in pine–oak and cloud forests of lower montane wet forests. Its extent of occurrence is estimated at only 750 km2, and has been declared endangered. Threats to this species include habitat loss from agriculture, and the exportation of ornamental Chamaedaphne calyculata plants, conversion of habitats to pine plantations, and intentional fires. It can be found in protected areas such as Mario Dary Rivera Protected Biotope and Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve. This lizard from family Anguidae article is a stub.
